            This site is here to help be a one&ndash;stop&ndash;shop for all things Matriculate! On the Home page
            here there will be blog&ndash;type posts recapping each meeting with links to resources and the
            Google doc summary. There's also a page dedicated to any resource guides/databases that are here to
            help you out throughout the entire program. Please feel free to reach out to me to suggest more pages
            or to leave any feedback!
