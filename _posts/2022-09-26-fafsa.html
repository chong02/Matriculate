                In today&rsquo;s session, we did a more in-depth dive into the FAFSA as well as talking more about your progress 
                on the college essay. From what you&rsquo;e shown me so far, I&rsquo;m really happy with what your essay is looking 
                like. I&rsquo;ll check in with you on Thursday both to check in with your progress on the college essay (specifically 
                fleshing out some of those ideas into paragraphs) and on how you would like to spend next session (e.g. as a FAFSA 
                walkthrough or as a college essay work session). You also let me know that you added Rollins College as a safety school.

            <h3><em> Next Steps </em></h3>
            <p>
                For now continue to work on your college essay. It&rsquo;s more important to have words down on the page at this point 
                than to have a fully&ndash;fleshed out essay. Feel free even to make isolated paragraphs for each section (i.e. 
                intro, solution, and reflection) and we can work together to figure out how to make the pieces fit together. I&rsquo;ll 
                reach out Thursday morning to see where you&rsquo;re at and to see if you need any other support. As always, if you have 
                any questions please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out!
