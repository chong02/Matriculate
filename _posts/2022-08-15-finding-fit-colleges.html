        <h3><strong> Summary </strong></h3>
        <p>
            In today&rsquo;s session we reviewed the importance of a College List and the varying 
            definitions of &ldquo;fitness&rdquo;: Social Fit, Academic Fit, and Financial Fit. 
            We also reviewed some college search tools that you can use as you&rsquo; working on 
            builidng your college list. You shared with me that you currently are leaning towards 
            private schools (because they provide greater financial aid and smaller class sizes) 
            and would prefer a small/medium, suburban campus although are not quite sure yet about 
            location. As of today, you&rsquo;re college list included the University of Florida, the 
            University of Miami, Harvard University, and Yale University.
