                Today&rsquo;s session was dedicated to a working session for your Common App Essay. After completing your first draft last week, 
                I had a chance to look things over and come up with some feedback on what you have so far. As a summary, what you have so far is 
                really really great! I know you said you weren&rsquo;t necessarily a fan, but I really liked the ideas/general structure of what 
                you have so far. We spent some more time in today&rsquo;s session specifically breaking down what we each liked about your essay 
                and what areas we thought could be improved, and I&rsquo;ll check in with you in the coming week to answer any questions you may 
                have or to help you out in any way.
