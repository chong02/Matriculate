            Really really informal/short session today just to go over your brainstorming topics.
             So far you&rsquo;ve done a fantastic job brainstorming and I&rsquo;m excited to get 
             started on Monday working on the beginnings of the writing process.

            Not anything major! Primarily, just make sure that you&rsquo;re continuing to brainstorm 
            (if you would like) and begin to think about the main takeaway/idea that can be conveyed 
            in your essay. As always, also make sure that you are continuing to think about your college 
            list (particularly thinking about paring down some of the reach schools taht you are thinking 
            about applying to). If you need any help with anything, please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out!
