                Super chill session today mostly focused on checking in on your progress with three different tasks: the college 
                list, resume, and college essay. We also spent some time reviewing what&rsquo;s to come (e.g. financial aid/FAFSA, 
                scholarships, supplemental essays, etc.). Also, be sure to submit your college list ASAP!
