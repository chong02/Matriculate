        <p>
            In today&rsquo;s session, we reviewed the specifics of what makes a good resume and looked over the sample resume
            from Matriculate. We also had a discussion about what is needed for letters of recommendation (e.g. the resume and 
            brag sheet/prompts to answer). We&rsquo;ll be sure to review your resume and send it out to your teachers as soon as 
            possible.
