            Super happy with your progress so major props to you on that!! Today we talked more about what makes a 
            good college essay to help you nail down what it is that you want to write about. It was lovely to hear 
            that you feel good about writing about your own experiences as an immigrant and how that&rsquo;s shaped 
            your worldview. We also talked about some things to consider as you&rsquo;re writing: time frame, how to 
            start the essay, sensory details, displaying successes + vulnerabilities, demonstrating personal growth, 
            and what it is that is your ultimate takeaway. We also scheduled the first draft of the college essay to 
            be done by next Monday for our regular session (9/5). I&rsquo;ll be sure to text you Thursday afternoon 
            to check in on your progress and see how you&rsquo;re doing!
