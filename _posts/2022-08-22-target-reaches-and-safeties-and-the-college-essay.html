        <h3><em> Next Steps </em></h3>
        <p>
            Continue to refine your college list using the tools provided in today&rsquo;s session and 
            brainstorm ideas for the CommonApp Essay. Sometime later this week, I&rsquo;ll check in with 
            you just to make sure everything is going smoothly. The process of thinking of what to write 
            about and actually writing the essay itself can be really challenging so please don&rsquo;t 
            hesitate to reach out to me if you have any questions about anything or are even just feeling 
            kind of stuck. I'm here to help you out!!
