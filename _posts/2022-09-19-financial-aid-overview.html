                In today&rsquo;s session we reviewed the basics of how financial aid works in hopes of preparing you for completing 
                the FAFSA/CSS Profile come October. We also reviewed the four main sources of financial aid (scholarships, grants, 
                work-study, and loans) and did a quick check-in regarding your progress with the college essay/resume. As a review, 
                the feedback on your college list was recently emailed out to you; since you decided to take Clemson off your list, 
                your list was flagged as missing an appropriate number of high graduation rate safety schools. I know there&rsquo;s a 
                lot on your plate right now, so I&rsquo;ll take a look at some potential schools that might interest you (that fit your 
                &ldquo;best-fit&rdquo; requirements) and I&rsquo;ll send them your way by the end of the day Tuesday (9/20).
